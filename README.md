## ‚ö° Quickstart

You can add this MCP server (using STDIO) to your MCP Client like VS Code, Claude, Cursor, Amazon Q Developer CLI, Windsurf Github Copilot via the package `@dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server`.

We recommend to always set it up for your current workspace instead of using it globally.

**VS Code**

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "npx-dynatrace-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "args": ["-y", "@dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest"],
      "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"
    }
  }
}
```

Please note: In this config, [the `${workspaceFolder}` variable](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/reference/variables-reference#_predefined-variables) is used.
This only works if the config is stored in the current workspaces, e.g., `<your-repo>/.vscode/mcp.json`. Alternatively, this can also be stored in user-settings, and you can define `env` as follows:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "npx-dynatrace-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "OAUTH_CLIENT_ID": "",
        "OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET": "",
        "DT_ENVIRONMENT": ""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mobile-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "OAUTH_CLIENT_ID": "",
        "OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET": "",
        "DT_ENVIRONMENT": ""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Amazon Q Developer CLI**

The [Amazon Q Developer CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-mcp-configuration.html) provides an interactive chat experience directly in your terminal. You can ask questions, get help with AWS services, troubleshoot issues, and generate code snippets without leaving your command line environment.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mobile-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "OAUTH_CLIENT_ID": "",
        "OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET": "",
        "DT_ENVIRONMENT": ""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration should be stored in `<your-repo>/.amazonq/mcp.json`.

## üîê Environment Variables

A **Dynatrace OAuth Client** is needed to communicate with your Dynatrace Environment. Please follow the documentation about
[creating an Oauth Client in Dynatrace](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/manage/identity-access-management/access-tokens-and-oauth-clients/oauth-clients),
and set up the following environment variables in order for this MCP to work:

### Required Variables

## üí° Example Prompts

Use these example prompts as a starting point. Just copy them into your IDE or agent setup, adapt them to your services/stack/architecture,
and extend them as needed. They're here to help you imagine how real-time observability and automation work together in the MCP context in your IDE.



**Write a DQL query from natural language:**
```
Show me error rates for the payment service in the last hour
```

**Explain a DQL query:**
```
What does this DQL do?
fetch logs | filter dt.source_entity == 'SERVICE-123' | summarize count(), by:{severity} | sort count() desc
```

**Chat with Davis CoPilot:**
```
How can I investigate slow database queries in Dynatrace?
```

**Find open vulnerabilities on production, setup alert.**
```
I have this code snippet here in my IDE, where I get a dependency vulnerability warning for my code.
Check if I see any open vulnerability/cve on production.
Analyze a specific production problem.
Setup a workflow that sends Slack alerts to the #devops-alerts channel when availability problems occur.
```
**Debug intermittent 503 errors.**
```
Our load balancer is intermittently returning 503 errors during peak traffic.
Pull all recent problems detected for our front-end services and
run a query to correlate error rates with service instance health indicators.
I suspect we have circuit breakers triggering, but need confirmation from the telemetry data.
```
**Correlate memory issue with logs.**
```
There's a problem with high memory usage on one of our hosts.
Get the problem details and then fetch related logs to help understand
what's causing the memory spike? Which file in this repo is this related to?
```

**Trace request flow analysis.**
```
Our users are experiencing slow checkout processes.
Can you execute a DQL query to show me the full request trace for our checkout flow,
so I can identify which service is causing the bottleneck?
```

**Analyze Kubernetes cluster events.**
```
Our application deployments seem to be failing intermittently.
Can you fetch recent events from our "production-cluster"
to help identify what might be causing these deployment issues?
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

In most cases, something is wrong with the OAuth Client. Please ensure that you have added all scopes as requested above.
In addition, please ensure that your user also has all necessary permissions on your Dynatrace Environment.

In case of any problems, you can troubleshoot SSO/OAuth issues based on our [Dynatrace Developer Documentation](https://developer.dynatrace.com/develop/access-platform-apis-from-outside/#get-bearer-token-and-call-app-function) and providing the list of scopes.

It is recommended to try access the following API (which requires minimal scopes `app-engine:apps:run` and `app-engine:functions:run`):

1. Use OAuth Client ID and Secret to retrieve a Bearer Token (only valid for a couple of minutes):
```bash
curl --request POST 'https://sso.dynatrace.com/sso/oauth2/token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
  --data-urlencode 'client_id={your-client-id}' \
  --data-urlencode 'client_secret={your-client-secret}' \
  --data-urlencode 'scope=app-engine:apps:run app-engine:functions:run'
```

2. Use `access_token` from the response of the above call as the bearer-token in the next call:
```bash
curl -X GET https://abc12345.apps.dynatrace.com/platform/management/v1/environment \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {your-bearer-token}'
```

3. You should retrieve a result like this:
```json
{
  "environmentId": "abc12345",
  "createTime": "2023-01-01T00:10:57.123Z",
  "blockTime": "2025-12-07T00:00:00Z",
  "state": "ACTIVE"
}
```

### Problem accessing data on Grail
Grail has a dedicated section about permissions in the Dynatrace Docs. Please refer to https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/platform/grail/data-model/assign-permissions-in-grail for more details.


## ü§ñ Agent Workflow Guide

### üîÑ Natural Language to DQL Workflow

**When to use this workflow:** When users ask questions in natural language that require data analysis, such as "Show me error rates for the payment service" or "What are the slowest database queries?"

**Step-by-step process:**

1. **Generate DQL from Natural Language**
   - Use `generate_dql_from_natural_language` tool
   - Provide a clear, specific natural language description
   - Example: "Show me error rates for the payment service in the last hour"
2. **Validate the Generated DQL**
   - Use `verify_dql` tool to check if the generated DQL is valid
   - This prevents execution errors and helps identify issues
3. **Execute the DQL Query**
   - Use `execute_dql` tool to run the validated query
   - Review the results to ensure they match the user's intent
4. **Iterate if Needed**
   - If results don't match expectations, refine the natural language description
   - Use `explain_dql_in_natural_language` to understand what the current query does
   - Generate a new DQL query with more specific requirements
5. **Provide Context and Analysis**
   - Use the results to provide meaningful insights
   - Correlate with other data sources if needed (problems, metrics, etc.)

**Example Iteration:**
```
User: "Show me database performance issues"
‚Üí Generate DQL: "fetch logs | filter dt.source_entity == 'database'"
‚Üí Verify DQL: Valid
‚Üí Execute DQL: Returns logs but not performance metrics
‚Üí Refine: "Show me database performance metrics and slow queries"
‚Üí Generate new DQL: "fetch metrics | filter metricId in ('builtin:database.performance')"
‚Üí Execute and provide results
```

### üéØ Best Practices for Agents

1. **Always validate DQL before execution** - Use `verify_dql` to prevent errors
2. **Iterate on natural language queries** - Refine descriptions based on results
3. **Provide context** - Explain what you're doing and why
4. **Use multiple tools** - Combine different tools for comprehensive analysis
5. **Handle errors gracefully** - If a tool fails, try alternative approaches
6. **Ask for clarification** - If user requests are ambiguous, ask for more details

### üîß Tool-Specific Guidelines

**Davis CoPilot Tools:**
- Use `generate_dql_from_natural_language` for initial query generation
- Use `explain_dql_in_natural_language` to understand complex queries
- Use `chat_with_davis_copilot` for general Dynatrace guidance
- Provide feedback using `submit_davis_copilot_feedback` to improve future responses

**DQL Execution:**
- Always verify DQL statements before execution
- Use specific time ranges and filters for better performance
- Consider using sampling for large datasets
- Provide clear explanations of what the query does

This workflow guide helps agents understand the most effective ways to use the Dynatrace MCP tools and provides clear patterns for common scenarios.

## Development

For local development purposes, you can use VSCode and GitHub Copilot.

First, enable Copilot for your Workspace `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "github.copilot.enable": {
    "*": true
  }
}

```

Second, add the MCP to `.vscode/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "my-dynatrace-mcp-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"
    }
  }
}
```

Third, create a `.env` file in this repository (you can copy from `.env.template`) and configure environment variables as [described above](#environment-variables).

Last but not least, switch to Agent Mode in CoPilot and reload tools.
