/**
 * Davis CoPilot API Integration
 *
 * This module provides access to Davis CoPilot AI capabilities including:
 * - Natural Language to DQL conversion
 * - DQL explanation in plain English
 * - AI-powered conversation assistance
 * - Feedback submission for continuous improvement
 *
 * Note: While Davis CoPilot AI is generally available (GA),
 * the Davis CoPilot APIs are currently in preview.
 * For more information: https://dt-url.net/copilot-community
 *
 * DQL (Dynatrace Query Language) is the most powerful way to query any data
 * in Dynatrace, including problem events, security issues, logs, metrics, and spans.
