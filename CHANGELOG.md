- Optimized `get_monitored_entity_details` tool to use direct entity type lookup for better performance.

## 0.5.0 (Release Candidate 3)

- Improved `list_vulnerabilities` tool to use DQL statement instead of classic API, and aligned parameters with `list_problems` tool
- Removed `get_vulnerability_details` tool as the same can now be achieved with a simple `execute_dql` call

- Removed unneeded scopes `environment-api:slo:read` (no tool is using this) and `environment-api:metrics:read` (anyway handled via execute DQL tool)
